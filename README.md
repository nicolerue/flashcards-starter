# FlashCards Game

### Abstract:

[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)

- This game is played in the terminal, and was created following the principles of Test Drive Development(TDD). The functions used to run the game were tested using Mocha and Chai.
- Assertion statements check the functionality of each function, accounting for both sad and happy paths. 

### Installation Instructions:

[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)

1. Open the terminal.
2. Navigate to the folder that you wish to clone the file into.
3. Ensure that the directory is initialized with git. If not, run `git init` in the terminal.
4. In the command line enter `git clone git@github.com:nicolerue/flashcards-starter.git`
5. In the command line enter `code .` to open the file
6. In the command line enter `node index.js`
7. Enjoy the application! 

### Preview of App:

[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

### Context:

[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)

- We had 4 days to complete the project.
- We are currently in week 1 of Mod 2 at Turing.

### Contributors:

[//]: <> (Who worked on this application? Link to their GitHubs.)

- This was a solo project.

### Learning Goals:

[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)

- Contribute code to an partially constructed application
- Follow spec/prompts to make a working application
- Write modular, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)
- Implement a robust testing suite using TDD
- Worked with Javascript, Mocha, and Chai

### Wins + Challenges:

[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)

- Writing my own tests was really fun, and beginning to better understand what each line in the testing files were doing, and experiencing how using TDD principles really solidifed how I can follow SRP.
- With every project, I'm gaining a better understanding of what is being returned from each function and how I can access those return values elswhere in the code.
